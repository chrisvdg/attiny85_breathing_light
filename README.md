# ATTINY85 Breathing Light

This project uses an ATTINY85 to make a breathing light that has a gaussian curve.
In between each pulse of light, the ATTINY85 goes into deep sleep for a random amount of time to conserve power as this is meant to be a battery (18650) powered project.

## Programming the ATTINY85

For the programming of the ATTINY85, a standard, official arduino UNO was used as ISP.

The following guide was used to be able to program the ATTINY85 via the Arduino uno:

Which I assume was based of this guide:
